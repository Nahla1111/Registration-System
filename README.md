# Registration-System
In the Company, a registration system is used to access the company.
This system accepts two inputs: the employee identification number (16 bits) and his password (4 bits).
If the company has 10 employees, construct their database and store it in the memory.
Then write a program to access the company. 
The inputs of the program are the employee identification and the password. 
The output is one bit (0/1) that means (denied/allowed).
